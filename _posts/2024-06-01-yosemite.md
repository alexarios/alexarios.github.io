An immersive highline set on the largest cliff in the Yosemite Valley, El Capitan 
* In another collaboration with Yosemite National Park, I worked with modelers to create a visually-accurate VR experience atop the cliffs of Yosemite.  
* Developed alongside a physical board tracked with lighthouse tracking to imitate the sensation of walking across a tightrope.
* Used sound design techniques synchronized with fans to create the illusion of height, adding to the thrill factor of the experience.
