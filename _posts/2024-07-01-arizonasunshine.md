<!--![ArizonaSunshine](/assets/arizonazombies.gif=640x360)-->

A location-based spinoff of the popular VR title Arizona Sunshine. 
* Worked on optimizing a custom OptiTrack motion capture system for the 30' x 40' haptic stage. 
* Programmed firearm haptics and a series of props, including fans, levers, and buttons via local server to work in tandem for a fully-immersive experience.
* I also helped in the development of the arcade-focused version of the experience: Horde Mode, which added a nighttime mode, new weaponry, and more aggressive zombie AI.
