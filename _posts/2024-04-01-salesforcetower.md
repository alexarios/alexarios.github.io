An original virtual reality roller coaster themed around the Salesforce Tower.
* With limited resources, I designed and developed a physics-based roller coaster track for VR.
* Led a team of developers and 3D modelers to create a one-of-a-kind San Francisco themed experience.
* Programmed the track alongside a 6-DoF simulator haptic chair to follow the pitch, roll, and yaw of the cart.
