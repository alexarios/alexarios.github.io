An early prototype hand interaction system for VR applications
* Founded Hand Interaction Framework, a virtual reality project focused on hand-tracking & haptics.
* Coordinated weekly work-sessions to design and develop an accurate hand-interaction API in the form of a Unity Asset for the Oculus Quest 2 platform.
* Created a working Proof-of-Concept, as well as a 0.1.1 release implementing seamless grabbing and manipulation of objects in virtual environments via Unity and C#.
